    <h1>Black-Jack-Game</h1>
    <p>This is a Python implementation of the popular casino card game, Blackjack (also known as 21). The objective of the game is to get a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. </p>
    
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.</li>
      <li>The player must decide to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand value).</li>
      <li>The dealer reveals their face-down card and continues to "hit" until their hand value is at least 17.</li>
      <li>The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without exceeding 21. </li>
    </ul>
